    "Some interesting things I noticed:\n",
    "1. For $k \\geq 2$, you can never have more than $k-2$ ones.\n",
    "    * If you had all $k$ ones, then the product is $1$ and the sum is definitely $\\geq 2$.\n",
    "    * If you had $k-1$ ones and the remaining number is $x$, then the product is $x$ and the sum is $\\geq x+1$.\n",
    "    * This means prime numbers will never be product-sum numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If any number $N$ is a product of two numbers where $x,y \\geq 2$ and $xy = N$, then the number of ones needed is $A = xy - (x + y)$ and the set needed is size $k = 2 + A$. In general, if you take a product of $n$ numbers, $x_i \\geq 2$ for each $i \\leq n$, such that $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i = N$, then the number of additional ones needed is $A = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ and thus the set needed is $k = n + A$.\n",
    "    * If $x + y > xy$ then either $x = 1$ or $y = 1$.\n",
    "    * This means the smallest set needed for a particular number is where $k = n + A$ is minimized, meaning that we want to minimize the difference between the product and the sum, while simultaneously using as few divisors possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For any $k$, the set $\\{k, 2, (k-2) \\text{ ones}\\}$ creates a product-sum number ($2k = k + k = k + 2 + (k - 2)$). The product is $2k$, so that tells us for any $k$, we only need to check numbers up to $2k$.\n"

    "This problem in math is defined as finding [partitions][1] of 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple start is to generate all lists for each sum, and use recursion and a cache to optimize slightly. However, even for $n = 100$, this is far too slow. So then we use a dynamic programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the approach is that for each integer $i$, if it has more partitions, it contributes to all future integers $j$. This is reflected in the double for loop, where we are considering the partitions of $i$ in the outer loop, and in the inner loop we update each future partition based on all previously completed partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in iteration $i = 1$, $j - i$ lags behind $j$ by $1$. So this is showing the effect of each $j-1$ partitions on the $j$ partitions. In iteration $i = k$, $j - i$ lags behind $j$ by $k$. So this is showing the effect of the $j-k$ partitions on the $j$ partitions.\n",

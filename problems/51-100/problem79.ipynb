    "I thought of this problem as a directed graph/tree based problem. In particular, I saw this problem as an application of the [toposort][1] (topological sorting) algorithm. Below is a general reasoning for how to apply it to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define each vertex as a digit. For each keylog, we create 3 directed edges: from the first to second number, from the first to third number, and finally from the second to third number (i.e., a directed edge between $A$ and $B$ tells us at least one keylog had $A$ before $B$). If there are cycles, then we have more work to do, since toposort is not possible with cycles. Fortunately, in this set of keylogs, there were no cycles (i.e., if $A$ is before $B$ then we know $B$ is not before $A$, as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "The passcode generation is simply toposort from there (I personally use Kahn's algorithm, although depth-first search would work well here, too). The only caveat here is that there are nodes here with no in-edges and no out-edges, so be sure to not include those in the final passcode--in this case, $4$ and $5$ should not be in the passcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to start with the number $N_0$ that has in-degree $0$ (and out-degree $> 0$), since this would suggest nothing can come before $N_0$. Append that number to the passcode. Then, for any number that has a directed edge from $N_0$ to them, we simply subtract $1$ from their in-degree. Then we repeat, looking for in-degree $0$, appending to the passcode, then subtracting $1$ from future in-degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular problem, every number was already in order by in-degree, and so we could just read off the passcode in order, instead of implementing Kahn's algorithm:\n",
    "* 7 comes first (in-degree = 0)\n",
    "* 3 comes second (in-degree = 1)\n",
    "* 1 comes third (in-degree = 2)\n",

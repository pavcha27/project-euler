    "This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we calculate the minimum path sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's similar to the maximum path sum (problem 18 and 67) in that from each node, we can only go in two directions, so we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to that problem, except the shape here is a rhombus (imagine turning the matrix $45^{\\circ}$), instead of a triangle. In the triangle version, we guarantee that the next row has more values than the previous row (so each number in the previous row has two numbers below it that we can check); in the rhombus, we have to be more careful about boundaries, since numbers on the edge can only go to 1 number in the next row.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also similar to the lattice paths (problem 15), since we can try to analyze each path, in that we can only move right and down, and we can analyze each path similarly. However, the big difference is there we could speed up the calculation signifcantly by doing a mathematical (combinatoric) formulation, since we were just counting; in this problem, we need to actually take the sume, so we can't just use a general mathematical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach I use here is a greedy approach (bottom-up dynamic programming), more similar to the lattice paths. We precalculate the sum of the first column and first row, since they are only affected by one direction (affected by above for first column, affected by left for first row). Then at each other number (starting from $(i,j) = (1,1)$), we add on the minimum of the number above and the number to the left. In notation, for a matrix $A$, we assign $A_{i,j} = A_{i,j} + \\min(A_{i,j-1}, A_{i-1,j})$."

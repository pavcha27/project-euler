We can construct the $n$ digit number form an $n-1$ digit number by adding another digit at the end. Let's say we take an increasing number $k$ that is $n-1$ digits long with maximum digit $k_{\\max}$. Note $k_{\\max} \\geq 1$, assuming no leading $0$s. In order to keep it increasing, we can only append a bigger number than $k_{\\max}$ at the end. This gives us $10 - k_{\\max}$ choices. The method is similar for decreasing numbers."

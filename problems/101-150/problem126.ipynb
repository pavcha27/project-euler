    "After doing some visualizations in an [isometric 3d cube drawer][1], first, I decided to do some programming to add layers in a brute-force way (not even optimal brute force). To do this, I just find the location of every current cube of a given shape, and move it 6 possible ways (up, down, left, right, forward, back). That gives us the next layer.\n",

So it stars at `max_vol = 100` but increments itself up until we find at least one hit for $C(n) = 1000$. Then take the minimum of those hits. It works well here.\n",

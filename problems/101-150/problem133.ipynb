    "$$\n",
    "Since the summation is an natural number (it's just sum of $10$ to some power), this shows us that $R(x^{a-1})$ is always a factor of $R(x^a)$. So this means we can solve the problem quickly by just nuking it with a really large value for the exponent $a$, and it will cover all the previous exponents prime factors. Even with an unneccesarily large exponent, the code runs very fast, using `pow` for modular exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the result is even more general! What we know is actually that $R(k) \\equiv 0 \\mod n \\iff k \\equiv 0 \\mod A(n)$. Remember that $R(A(n))$ is the smallest repunit that is divisible by $n$. So this $k$ must be larger than $A(n)$ and $k$ must be a multiple of $A(n)$. In particular what this tells us is that if $p$ is a prime factor of $R(10^9)$, then $A(p)$ is a factor of $10^9$. But that's only possible if $A(p)$ has $2$ and $5$ as prime factors, since $10^9$ has only $2$ and $5$ as prime factors!\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us another way to solve the problem--find all the $p$ where $A(p)$ has only $2$ and $5$ as prime factors. However we don't actually have to calculate $A(p)$, since that's slow. Instead we can combine the two above methods: use the second method to find the best exponent to \"nuke\" with for the first method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $A(p) = 2^a 5^b$. Consider some upper bound $L$ (in this problem $L = 10^5$). Then the largest possible exponent is when $2^{a-1} < A(p) = 2^a < L \\implies a = \\lfloor \\log_2(L) \\rfloor$. This means we set $n = 10^a$ as the exponent and \"nuke\" the problem."

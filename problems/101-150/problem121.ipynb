In general, as you might expect, we are multiplying probabilities within each even and then adding up the various possible events--so for example, if you win with $3$ blue rounds and $2$ red rounds, and if you win red in the second and third round, you would multiply $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ and add $6$ to the remaining other possibilities ($(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), \\dots, (4,5)$).\n",
